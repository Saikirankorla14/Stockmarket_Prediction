# Stockmarket_Prediction
📈 LSTM Stock Price Predictor with Technical Indicators

This project uses an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network to predict stock prices using both historical price data and technical indicators like RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands. Built using Python, TensorFlow, and pandas-ta.

🧠 What It Does

- Loads historical stock price data
- Calculates technical indicators (RSI, MACD, SMA, Bollinger Bands)
- Scales and sequences the data for LSTM
- Trains an LSTM model to predict future stock prices
- Visualizes actual vs predicted prices

📦 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- TensorFlow / Keras 🤖
- Pandas & NumPy 🧮
- Matplotlib 📊
- pandas-ta 📉 (for technical indicators)

📁 Project Structure

.
├── historical_data.csv       # Input file (Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume)
├── lstm_stock_predictor.ipynb # Main Jupyter/Colab notebook
├── README.md                 # Project documentation (you are here!)

⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. Clone or open in Colab:
   - Open in Google Colab or clone locally if using Jupyter

2. Install required libraries:
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib tensorflow pandas-ta

3. Load your dataset:
   Ensure your historical_data.csv has columns like: Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume.

🧪 Technical Indicators Used

- RSI: Relative Strength Index
- MACD: Moving Average Convergence Divergence
- SMA_5, SMA_10: Simple Moving Averages
- BBL/BBU: Bollinger Bands (Lower/Upper)

📊 Sample Output
 
✅ Next Steps / Extensions

- 🔁 Multi-day forecasting
- 💹 Simulate trading signals (buy/sell)
- 🧪 Hyperparameter tuning
- 📈 Use external data (e.g., news sentiment)
